A short course from DeepLearning.AI platform regarding AI Agents, that can automate tasks on browser.

An AI browser agent is an artificial intelligence system designed to autonomously navigate and interact with web pagesâ€”just like a human using a browser. It can read content, click links, fill out forms, extract data, and even make decisions based on what it sees.
