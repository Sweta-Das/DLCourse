## 1. LLM-Using-Semantic-Search
A short course from DeepLearning.AI platform about Large Language Models using Semantic Search.<br/>

### **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
Large Language Models, like GPT, are AI systems trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like language. They can perform tasks such as answering questions, summarizing text, translating languages, and generating content by predicting the most likely next word or phrase based on context.

### **Semantic Search:**
Semantic search is a technique that improves search accuracy by understanding the **meaning** behind words rather than just matching keywords. Instead of looking for exact terms, it uses natural language processing (NLP) and embeddings to find results that are contextually and conceptually relevant, even if they don't contain the exact search terms.

### How They Work Together:
LLMs can power or enhance semantic search by generating embeddings (vector representations of meaning) for both queries and documents, allowing more intelligent and accurate information retrieval based on context.

## 2. ChatGPT Prompt Development

## 3. Building AI Browser Agents
A short course from DeepLearning.AI platform regarding AI Agents, that can automate tasks on browser.

An AI browser agent is an artificial intelligence system designed to autonomously navigate and interact with web pagesâ€”just like a human using a browser. It can read content, click links, fill out forms, extract data, and even make decisions based on what it sees.

### Key Features:
- Web navigation: Can visit websites, scroll, and click buttons or links.
- Information extraction: Gathers relevant data from web pages (like product prices, news, or user reviews).
- Automation: Performs repetitive tasks like logging in, submitting forms, or scraping content.
- Language understanding: Uses natural language processing to understand user instructions and web content.
